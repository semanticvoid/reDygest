the clinton heart surgeon doesnt look anything like the surgeons from grey anatomy...sooo dissapointed!
Not a Bill Clinton supporter but praying for his recovery.  Stints within a couple of years of bypass surgery is NOT a good sign.  #tcot
Clinton Doc: Now he's less likely for future heart attacks.
Would like Bill Clinton to recover asap. Our thoughts and prayers are with you.
