A bill to provide for establishment of Lokpal and Lokayuktas in states to go into corruption cases in government organisations was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.
The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Bill,2011, already passed by Lok Sabha, was moved for consideration and passage in the House by Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs V Narayanasamy.
The Minister started a discussion in the House explaining the features of the bill.
The Lokpals and Lokayuktas will enquire into allegations of corruption against certain public functionaries.
The UPA does not enjoy a majority in the Upper House.
Several political parties, including certain UPA allies, are opposed to some provisions of the bill.
“I hope that everyone will come around. We will have to carry everybody and pass the bill,” Union Minister Minister V Narayanasamy said.
However, the Trinamool was firm in its demand for deletion of Lokayukta provision from Lokpal Bill. It is likely to press for amendment in Rajya Sabha.
Earlier Mr. Union Minister V Narayanasamy said Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee had spoken to leaders of Trinamool Congress, which have given notice for amendment to the crucial legislation, and has explained the situation to them.
Trinamool Congress, which has 6 members in the 243-member Upper House where the Congress and its allies do not have majority, wants removal of the provisions relating to the setting up of Lokayuktas in the state which is contained in the Bill passed by Lok Sabha.
Mr. Narayanasamy said it has been made clear that the Lokayukta aspect will not come into force without consent of the state and added, “I think they will all come around.”
Asked if the need for a Joint Session of Parliament for passage of Lokpal Bill would arise if it failed in Rajya Sabha, he said, “I don’t visualise that situation.”
