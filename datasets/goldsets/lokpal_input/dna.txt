Noted advocate and BJP member Ram Jethmalani today created a flutter in the Rajya Sabha when he made certain remarks against persons having money stashed away in Swiss banks.
Participating in the debate on Lokpal Bill, Jethmalani referred to an article published in an European magazine in 1991 that contained names, photographs and bank account numbers.
His remarks were strongly objected to by Congress members led by Mani Shankar Aiyar.
Deputy Chairman K Rahman Khan, who repeatedly asked the protesting members to take their seats, said it was not correct to bring the name of Prime Minister and wanted removal of the reference made by Jethmalani.
After the ruling, Jethmalani spoke about the protocol that India signed with the Swiss government on August 30 last year on double taxation avoidance treaty and used a word to describe the government's intention. 
The Chair expunged the remark, saying it was unparliamentary.
The BJP leader's remark again drew sharp reactions from the ruling benches and Khan had a tough time restoring order.
When order was finally restored, Jethmalani said the protocol signed with the Swiss government says India will not seek information about past and only future information on double tax avoidance would be sought.
Aiyar and others objected saying Jethmalani was raising an issue that was not linked with the issue under discussion. 
Opposition BJP and AIADMK members stood up to counter Congress members.
Khan asked members to resume their places and remarked that obstruction is on both sides. 
"If you don't cooperate, how can Chair run the House," he asked, appealing to members to resume their places.
