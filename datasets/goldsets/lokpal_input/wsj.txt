The fog of warâ is a phrase that describes the irrational logic, the skewed vision, the sense of disorientation that afflicts those in the midst of battle.
The past three days seem to have been lost in the same metaphorical pea soup.
After seven months of sparring between the government and Anna Hazare over the shape an anticorruption ombudsman should take, we witnessed a final battle in which every side managed to lose. 
It all came to a catastrophic end after midnight Thursday when the upper house of Parliament adjourned for this session without voting on the anti-graft bill passed by the lower house Tuesday.
Mr. Hazare lost because his calling off of his public fast and of his occupy-the-jails campaign slated for this weekend delivered a big blow to his credibility. 
And it was clear that the masses he so effectively assembled in Delhi in August would no longer materialize for him. 
He deserves credit for being the catalyst that got the ombudsman, or Lokpal, bill in front of Parliament in the first place but he overplayed his hand. 
Then, after insisting that the governmentâ€™s version of the bill was unacceptable and deserved to be protested vociferously, he abruptly packed his bags and retreated, the future of his movement unclear.
The Bharatiya Janata Party and the Trinamool Congress may have scored tactical victories by tripping up the government in the Rajya Sabha Thursday with their sudden insistence on the sanctity of the separation of state and federal government.
But the BJP now has the distinction of being the party that stood in the way of a major anticorruption bill â€” whether it was the right bill for the purpose or not will be lost on most voters â€” and itâ€™s hard to see how even a Herculean performance in the upper house by Arun Jaitleyâ€™s jowels will suddenly win new supporters to a party that has singularly failed to turn the governmentâ€™s many woes into a surge in its own popularity.
For the Trinamool Congress, insisting on amendments that helped sink the bill for this session may have made some bizarre sense for the partyâ€™s position in West Bengal.
But it has cemented Mamata Banerjeeâ€™s reputation as an unreliable ally, a government spoiler, an embarrassing associate that may not serve her longer-term political interests and adds unnecessary instability to an already-teetering government.
Still, the fallout for these two parties seems benign compared to the funk that will now beset the Congress party, which has just lost another major initiative â€” as well as an entire year of governing.
In the summer, after bungling the major Hazare agitation, it was hard to imagine the governmentâ€™s image suffering more or its incompetence increasing. 
Indeed, the winter session of Parliament appeared to offer some slim hope of redemption with the governmentâ€™s stated determination to pass a Lokpal bill.
Instead, during this Parliamentary session we had the first major economic reform in years â€” allowing in international supermarkets â€” approved and then reversed to the great dismay of foreign investors and many Indian companies. 
And now we have the fiasco of Thursdayâ€™s Rajya Sabha debate to cap a wasted Parliamentary session in addition to all the other wasted sessions in the past 12 months.
If a government repeatedly canâ€™t introduce key new measures because its own allies reject them, then it probably is not a government that is fit to govern. 
Nor is its leadership fit to lead. 
This may be starting to dawn on Congress party leaders and the only answer may be to go back to the voters with a midterm poll to reset the dynamics of a broken coalition or to make way for someone else. 
It would be an ignominious end to a dreadful second term â€” and disastrous for what little is left of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhâ€™s reputation â€” but the alternative appears to be not one wasted year but four.
Ultimately, though, the biggest loser of all is India.
For those who latched onto Anna Hazare, they have seen him pay the price of pushing too far. 
Itâ€™ll be hard to reignite those same supportersâ€™ passion for the cause or its leader in the future. 
Last summer wonâ€™t easily be repeated.
For those who wanted the government to step up and take charge, they have seen instead the United Progressive Alliance fall to new lows of mismanagement, disorganization and ineffectiveness.
