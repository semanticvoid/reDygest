Taking part in the Lokpal debate in the Rajya Sabha, Samajwadi Party MP Ram Gopal Yadav on Thursday opposed the Lokpal Bill in the present form and objected on the issue of bringing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) under the purview of the Lokpal.
"We oppose the Bill in present form," said Yadav.
"People think the Lokpal Bill will eradicate corruption, which is wrong. We have to improve our character," Yadav added.
He also said that the SP wants amendments in organisational structure of Lokpal.
Yadav also expressed his apprehension that the Lokpal will be misused like the CBI and demanded that the CrPC should not be touched.
He also said that the party also doesn't want to make the CBI answerable to the Lokpal.
"All CBI investigations should go to court. Lokpal should not intervene," said Yadav.
"The CBI Director should be appointed like Lokpal, and the tenure should be five years fixed," said Yadav.
Yadav also demanded that the former MPs should be out of the Lokpal's purview.
Opposing the Lokayukta clause, the SP MP said, "Chapter 3 is against Federal structure. We oppose it and want amendments."
He also advocated for inclusion of the media in the Lokpal and urged the Rajya Sabha MPs to support the amendments that the SP asked for. "I request all MPs to support our amendments," said Yadav.
